CarlTron - version 1.

Team: Sabastian Mugazambi, Kiet Tran, Derek Shang, Frederik Roenn Stensaeth

Current Features:
- ability to player 2 player mode
- ability to go to a screen that has instructions / rules.
- ability for each player to control the direction of their respective LightCycles.
- ability to detect crashes against the walls of the grid.
- ability to detect collisions with paths.
- ability to detect head-on collisions between LightCycles.
- ability to show the ‘correct winner’ (granted that it is with a path, or one of the LightCycles going off the grid (but not both at the same time)).
- ability to use a turbo to increase the movement speed of the LightCycle (this does not leave a proper path yet, and collision detection when turbo is activated is not complete).
- be able to go back to the main menu when a game is over.
- be able to start a new game once reached the victory page.

Note:
- turbos mess with collisions —> can make the game freeze.
- both games going off the grid / crashing at the same time will not be counted as a draw.
- if two keys are pressed within a single frame, collisions with own path is possible and the game does freeze sometimes.
- no jumps are available as of now.
- the scoreboard on-top of the gameplay window does not update and displays wrong information.
- the victory page does not display the correct score.
- 1 player mode has not been implemented yet.


Enjoy!
