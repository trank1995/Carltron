  IntelliJ and click 'Run Main.main()'.

- "java carltron.Main"

Current Features:
- ability to play 2-player mode.
- ability to go to a screen that has instructions / rules.
- ability for each player to control the direction of their LightCycle.
- ability to detect crashes against the walls of the grid.
- ability to detect collisions with paths.
- ability to detect head-on collisions between LightCycles.

- ability to use a jump to jump over a path.
- be able to go back to the main menu when a game is over.
- be able to start a new game once reached the victory page.
- ability to see the CarlTron logo in the header of the game window.
- ability to play 1-player mode. The AI is not very sophisticated.
- ability to see how many turbos/ jumps remaining for each player.
- players earn/ lose badgets depending on the difference in score between the
  two players.

NOTE:
- when using a turbo the LightCycle does not leave a continuous path anymore,
  this is intentional. We have chosen to make it this way, as it adds some
  complexity to what strategy the users choose. You can now either go for speed
  or be sure that whatever path you leave behind you have no holes in it. This
  can lead to some quite interesting gameplays, as if synced completely two
  LightCycles with activated turbos can interweave their paths (they normally
  would have crashed) when going in opposite directions.


Enjoy!
